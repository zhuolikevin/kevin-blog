> Basic knowledge-base for computer science, especially for technical interviews.

## Data Structure

1. Hash Table
    - hash(key) % arrayLength
    - Collision (If we got collision, keys are required to stored together with value)
        - Chaining: linked list or balanced BST
        - Open Addressing: find another available spot
    - Dynamic Resizing
        - Resize when load factor too large (e.g. Java HashMap 0.75, Python dict 2/3)
        - Requires copying all entries

1. Array v.s. Linked List

  ||Array|Linked List|
  |---|---|---|
  |Access|Random|Sequential|
  |Memory Structure|Continuous memory location|Any available location (extra space for pointers)|
  |Insert/Delete|Shift elements|Only change pointers|
  |Memory Allocation|Compile time|Run time|

## Operating Systems

1. Process v.s. Thread

  |Process|Thread|
  |---|---|
  |Run in separated memory space|Run in shared memory space (heap, data, code, file descriptor **EXCEPT Stack and Registers**)|
  |It has its own copy of data segment of the parent process|It has direct access to data segment of its process|
  |Interprocess Communication (IPC)|Directly communication with threads of its process|

1. Stack v.s. Heap

  |Stack|Heap|
  |---|---|
  |Very fast access|*Relatively* slow access|
  |Local variables only|Variables can be accessed globally|
  |Limit on stack size (OS-dependent)|No limit on memory size|
  |Space managed by CPU, no memory fragmented|No guaranteed space efficiency, memory may be fragmented. You **MUST** manage memory (allocate/free variables)|
  |Variables can not be resized|Variables can be resized with `realloc()`|

## Database

1. Inner Join v.s. Outer Join

  - **Inner Join**: "Intersection" of two tables, must be some common attributes and rows.
  - **Outer Join**: *Inner Join + no corresponding matching rows*, for those unshared data attributes, use NULL
    - Left/Right Outer Join: All data in left/right table and shared data.
    - Full Outer Join: All data in both tables. Un shared attributes got NULL

1. SQL v.s NoSQL

  |SQL|NoSQL|
  |---|---|
  |Structured data, Schema, Tables|Semi or no structure. Key-Value/Document based/Column-oriented...|
  |ACID|Eventually Consisitency|
  |well designed can perform better than bad-designed NoSQL|Usually faster as no JOINs or complex SQL queries|
  ||Simpler data model can be easier to scale|
  |Better data integrity, constrains like foreign key or so||

  - Usually we choose SQL(RDMS) for logical related discrete data, essential data integrity/consistency, standards-based proven tech and better community support
  - Usually we choose NoSQL for bad structured data, speed and scalability is more important than consistency.

## Computer Networks & Web

1. TCP v.s. UDP

  ||TCP|UDP|
  |---|---|---|
  |Connection|Connection Oriented. Three way handshake|Connectionless|
  |Overhead|Large|Small|
  |Order|Guaranteed|No guarantee. Best effort|
  |Reliability|Guaranteed|No guarantee. Best effort|
  |Error Checking|Checksum and error recovery|Checksum but discard error message directly|
  |Data Flow Control|Yes|No|
  |Usage|Require high reliability, transmission time is less critical|Needs fast and efficient transmission|

1. What happens when visit *google.com*?
  - Browser looks up IP address for the domain name
    - browser cache -> OS host files -> router cache -> ISP DNS cache â€“> recursive search[root nameserver, .com/.org... nameserver, Wikipedia.com nameserver]
  - Browser initiates a TCP connection
  - Browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server
    - May not be a web server, may be load balancer and then redirect to server
  - Web server handle the HTTP request, maybe also talk to DB
  - Web server sends back a HTTP response through TCP
  - Browser received HTTP response, may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request
  - Browser builds DOM tree and render
  - Browser sends GET requests for objects (img, CSS, JS...) embedded in HTML (Maybe requests to CDN)
  - User interaction. Browser sends further asynchronous requests (AJAX)

1. How to solve slowly website visiting problem?
  - Network
    - [Diagnose] Everyone or just you? **traceroute** show how long it takes at each hop from you to the server.
    - [Solution] Contact your ISP or just wait (most ISP will have it up within few hours)?
  - Client Side
    - [Diagnose] Serve a pure simple HTML page. If it is not slow, then the problem may not lie on network or server side.
    - [Solution]
      - No cache for IP? May be the time to query DNS
      - CSS/JS combination, compression, uglify; image compression, sprites; js async or delay
      - Content lazy loading
      - CDN for static resources
  - Server
    - Too many requests at a time? More servers, dispatcher, load balancer
    - Server down? Replica for backup
  - Database
    - [Diagnose] Load a static page without database interaction. If it is not slow, then the problem may be at database part.
    - [Solution] Query slow? Build index

1. GET v.s. POST

  ||GET|POST|
  |---|---|---|
  |Query Data|In URL|In HTTP body|
  |Cache|CAN be cached|CANNOT be cached|
  |Browser History|Remain in browser history|NOT remain in browser history|
  |Bookmark|CAN be bookmarked|CANNOT be bookmarked|
  |Size|Have data length restriction|No data length restriction|

  - Never use GET for sensitive data like password
  - POST v.s PUT
    - PUT is to put a file or resource **EXACTLY** at the URI
    - POST sends data to specified URI and expects the resource there to **handle the request**. The web server can now determine what to do with the data

1. REST
  - **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
  - Use nouns (resources) instead of verbs in SOAP-RPC
  - Use HTTP methods GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for what you want to do for the resources
  - Use URIs as identifiers for the resources
  - Use JSON or XML for state transfer between client and server. Server maintain no state for clients.
